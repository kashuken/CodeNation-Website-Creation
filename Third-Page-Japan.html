                    Culturally unique and scenically beautiful there is nothing quite like a holiday to Japan and it continues to grow in popularity. Alongside soaring skyscrapers, and neon lights, treasured ancient traditions like the graceful geisha, and the art of the tea ceremony still hold their place in daily Japanese life. Amongst the history and religious shrines, you will find modern cities, meet the politest people, you are ever likely to encounter, dine on delicious local delicacies and discover why Japan continues to be a "must visit" destination.<br> Japan gives you the chance to see some of this amazing country's best-known attractions and cities, such as Tokyo, Mount Fuji, Kyoto and Hiroshima. We will also show you some of Japan's lesser-known spots and hidden gems, such as the beautiful preserved old towns of Takayama and Kurishiki and the delightful Higashi Chaya district in Kanazawa. We visit not one, but two of Japan's most famous gardens, ride the famous bullet train, learn to make sushi and even have dinner with a Maiko, an apprentice Geisha. For those that wish there is also an opportunity to stay in a traditional Japanese Ryokan.<br> Along the way, you will be guided by our expert Distant Journeys Tour Manager, who is there to ensure you get the very best from your holiday, whether there are arrangements you need or you are simply seeking advice on the local area.<br><br>Holidays start at around £80 per day up to £600 for more luxurious accommodation. We cover multiple destinations for varied holiday tours on what kind of holiday experience you are looking for such as relaxation or adventure looking around the various ruins.
