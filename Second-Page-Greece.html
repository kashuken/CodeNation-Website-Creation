                <p>
                    The Greek coastline is punctuated by superb beaches, while its mountainous interior urges you to dust off your hiking boots and explore. Yet perhaps its greatest riches are the Greek islands, ranging from backwaters where the boat calls twice a week to resorts like Santorini and Mykonos.<br>For anyone with a cultural bone in their body, Greece travel cannot fail to inspire. But the call to cultural duty will never be too overwhelming on a Greek holiday. The simple pleasures - swimming in balmy seas at dusk, talking and drinking under the stars, eating fresh, uncomplicated food - are just as appealing. Also, the genuine welcome you receive at the simplest taverna is enough to get you booking next year's break as soon as you get home.<br>Further north, Thessaloniki gives the capital a run for its money, with sophisticated restaurants, a buzzing nightlife and its own culture scene.<br>Don't think the Greek islands hold the country's only beautiful beaches: the long, sandy stretches of the Peloponnese are well worth a visit and easily accessible from the mainland.Take the tourist road less travelled with a trip around the Central Mainland or Northern Mainland, with brilliant mountain hiking and trekking opportunities as well as tonnes of history and the all-important spectacular beaches.<br>Holidays start at around £120 and go up to around £400 for 7 days for a couple.  More exclusive and adults based holidays can be more expensive ranging up to £900. We cater for holidays for sight-seeing tours and the breathtaking various ruins that are found all over the islands and relaxation for couples who want to enjoy time away from it all.
